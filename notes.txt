Not these:
LinkBrowser/LB
Devins SideFeed



intercept navigation at onBeforeRequest? no, because of communication overhead

therefore, when LB is activated, content scripts will be injected from the background page
cause there's no an API for that,
this cuts down memory usage and increases browser performance
by not injecting javascript in each tab

LB will be activated through some chrome in the browser, aka a browser action,
or it could be a 'page action' in chrome, but I'm not targetting chrome because
chrome does not respect your privacy as well as other browsers

# Architecture

Algorithm:
  When you click a link: check the dom tree structure.. tag names should be good enough? except for maybe table elements, if the tag name based selector matches 2 or more elements, and those anchor tags have the same css size styling

  Or if there's a list taking up the majority of the screen, then any anchor tags within those list elements will open in the detail pane. Links without an href attribute are assumed to be javascript actions and will be ignored.

  3 or more elements with the same tag name, same css for spacing and dimensions (at least width should match?) taking up the majority of the screen
