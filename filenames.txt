gen.js is my general javascript library, used for GET, POST, string.has, and a nifty each function

manifest.json says to run code on google.com/search and /webhp pages, and 
start.js figures out if we should actually run the extension or not. It examines url's closer because pattern matching is lame in manifest.json

bg_init.js has some pusher, install, and setting default stuff. 
background.html contains the messaging API.

fresh.js is triggered by starting with htmlGroup, which start.js calls. It constructs and adds many dom elements. Very much the real beginning of the extension. Also adds hardStyleText as a stylesheet, which is solely responsible for reformatting google's search page into a sidebar.

messaging.js holds the messaging API and provides a message function (I think)

Also includes the setting api. (the set() and get() methods) The setting API uses both cookies and localStorage.

neif.js stands for Never Ending InFinite loop. It loops every 200 milliseconds looking for a change in the first link, and then re-rigs links so that onclick the url is opened in the iframe. It uses preview(url, li) from preview.js to open them in the iframe.

specific/google.com.js rigs the google.com homepage so instant searching doesn't trigger and all shit breaks loose.

popup.html is for the browser button. manifest.json directs the button to this file.
